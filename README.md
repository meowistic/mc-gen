# MC-GEN
A pretty simple minecraft username generator/checker, using official mojang API

#  Setup

1. Download the newest version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. After downloading both of the files (`main.py`, `requirements.txt`), open your command prompt.
3. type  ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` into the command prompt, this will download all the required packages.
4. Open `main.py ` and enjoy the program!

# IMPORTANT âš 
1. Use this at your own risk. This sends many requests to the mojang api from YOUR IP address. proceed at your own risk or use a proxy.
2. do NOT delete config.txt (this saves your options, i will change the settings system someday)
3. users.txt is where all the available usernames will be typed in.
